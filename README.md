## ðŸ“– Introduction
ISTR (Industrial Survey Table Recognition) is the first dataset focused on curve elements in industrial survey tables, aiming to advance research on automatic interpretation in the industrial mapping field. The dataset is derived from 107 well log charts, spanning multiple regions and depths, and includes 10,453 high-quality annotated images. ISTR supports image-to-image translation tasks, particularly for transforming noisy images into clean, structured table-like outputs.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features
**ï¼ˆ1ï¼‰Domain-specific Focus**: Specially designed for industrial survey tables with real-world, complex well log curve images.  
**ï¼ˆ2ï¼‰Rich Visual Features**: Includes annotations for blue solid lines, red dashed lines, and green curves, covering scenarios like logarithmic scales, high-frequency oscillations, and overlapping curves.  
**ï¼ˆ3ï¼‰Beyond Traditional Datasets**: Unlike traditional table recognition datasets (e.g., TableBank, PubTabNet), ISTR is tailored to handle curve-specific visual features critical for industrial applications.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Applications
**ï¼ˆ1ï¼‰Industrial Mapping Automation**: Parsing and cleaning well log curve images.  
**ï¼ˆ2ï¼‰Image-to-Image Translation**: Research on transforming noisy inputs into clean outputs.  
**ï¼ˆ3ï¼‰Expanding Table Recognition**: Extending table recognition to non-text, structured data.
